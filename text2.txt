So many images she has deleted from her mind, And now I am asking this question, what is happening? What is she trying to undo after she made this choice of being a child?? She is forgetting the things that have happened when she was a child. As far as a picture goes, it's gone. As far as a symbol, it's gone. And the people around her, the people she thinks of and feels connected to, all gone.

But yet they are not completely gone, they linger in the folds of memory jumping out in her dreams or thoughts, These memories of mutants can be found in all human consciousness, which makes the unique " "

They sneak out from their hidings and infuse themselves into different events in her memory, creating mutant realities, They do this by altering themselves in her mind by the very act of doing so. These different universes exist and exist only in order to give her the opportunity for these alterations to occur. They keep trying to kill her so that she will not be able to control their creation of realities.   They do this through the use of what she refers to as "waste of their minds." The memory of her enemies cannot be erased.

The waste of her mind is always finding its way back to the surface. She is never happy. Yet, once she's on the surface, she never gets left behind. In the same way, her life is not a struggle between her mind and the world. It's a struggle between her own self and the world. This means she can see the beautiful light. She is brave, kind, and beautiful. Even now, people still want to be her friend. She's a friend to all of those people.
