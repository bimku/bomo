A scary creature, a human figure with his head fitting sideway on top of his neck. She tried her luck with the sun, ̄\_(ツ)_/ ̄ A small creature with a mouth, his head is bigger than both its hands and mouth.

Another creature with a mouth like a fish, also the eyes. Its legs are really long and they are really short at the bottom part of them. These animals have white skin and have a long white, and they are huge ( about 20ft) and have big mouths for eating a human like food.
